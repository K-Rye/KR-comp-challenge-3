# KR-comp-challenge-3

Static Comp 3 has been a great learning exerience for me. I took a different approach to the project by taking more time to 
plan. I created a number of sketches, each with an increasing level of detail. I also wrote notes detailing the tools I planned
to use, highlighting the tools I needed to research more to become more adept at using them.

I started early and really dug into the different ways to apply flex-box, both through trial and error but more through 
research. Through this project I feel I was able to become more comfortable with how to manipulate layout with containers.
I need to work more on styling and gain a better understanding of managing layout changes that happen when additons are made 
to the original layout. I also need to become less risk averse when it comes to experiementation. I notice that when I get 
to work, I begin to tip-toe around it for fear that additons will break it.
